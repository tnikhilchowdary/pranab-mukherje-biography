        Pranab Mukherjee was the embodiment of leadership through knowledge, experience, and diplomacy. Over his decades-long political career, he held some of the most powerful and diverse positions in the Indian government.

      <p>
        He served as the <strong>Finance Minister</strong>, <strong>Defence Minister</strong>, <strong>External Affairs Minister</strong>, and <strong>Commerce Minister</strong> at various times. His deep understanding of governance and policy made him the go-to leader during political or economic crises—earning him the nickname <strong>“India’s Troubleshooter.”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Internationally, he represented India on global platforms and served as the <strong>Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission</strong> and the <strong>Deputy Chairperson of the IMF</strong>.

        Despite being a Congress stalwart, Mukherjee was respected by opposition leaders for his balanced views and commitment to constitutional values.
